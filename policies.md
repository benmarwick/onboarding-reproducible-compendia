## DataONE Policies

### Comendium submission

* For a compendium to be considered for the DataONE suite, authors must initiate a request on the [onboarding](https://github.com/benmarwick/onboarding-reproducible-compendia) repository.
* Upon an initial assessment (see Aims and Scope below), an DataONE member will assign a reviewer or follow up with additional steps. This process usually happens within 5 business days.
* Compendia are reviewed for quality, fit, documentation, clarity and the review process is quite similar to a manuscript review (see our [compendium guide](packaging_guide.md) and [reviewing guide](reviewing_guide.md) for more details). Unlike a manuscript review, this process will be an ongoing conversation.
* Once all major issues and questions, and those addressable with reasonable effort, are resolved, the editor assigned to a compendium will make a decision (accept, hold, or reject). Rejections are usually done early (before the review process begins), but in rare cases a compendium may also be rejected after review & revision.

### <a href="#fit" name="#fit"></a>Aims and Scope

DataONE aims to support compendia that support reproducible research and
managing the data lifecycle for scientists.  Compendia submitted to DataONE should fit into one or more of the following
categories.  If you are unsure whether your package fits into one of these
categories, please open an issue as a pre-submission inquiry
([**Examples**](https://github.com/benmarwick/onboarding-reproducible-compendia/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A0%2Fpresubmission)).

As as this is a living document, these categories may change through
time and not all previously onboarded compendia would be in-scope today.  While
we strive to be consistent, we evaluate compendia on a case-by-case basis and may
make exceptions.

#### Compendia categories

* Manuscripts for submission to a scholarly journal
* Reports for funding agencies and other organisations

### Role of the DataONE leadership team

Compendium authors will continue to maintain and develop their software after acceptance into DataONE. Unless explicitly added as collaborators, the DataONE team will not interfere much with day to day operations. 

### Ownership of compendium

Authors of contributed compendia essentially maintain the same ownership they had prior to their compendium joining the DataONE review process. 

### Compendia removal

In the unlikely scenario that a contributor of a compendium requests removal of their compendium from the suite, we will honour that request.

### Quality commitment 

DataONE strives to develop and promote high quality research. To ensure that your compendium meets our criteria, we review all of our submissions as part of the onboarding process, and even after acceptance will continue to chime in with improvements and bug fixes. 

Despite our best efforts to support contributed software, errors are the responsibility of individual maintainers. Buggy, unmaintained software may be removed from our suite at any time.

### Maintainer responsiveness

If compendia maintainers do not respond in a timely manner to requests for
 fixes from us, we will remind the maintainer a number
of times, but after 3 months (or shorter time frame, depending on how
critical the fix is) we will make the changes ourselves.

We urge maintainers to make sure they are receiving GitHub notifications, as
well as making sure emails from DataONE staff are not going to their
spam box. 

### <a href="#code-of-conduct" name="code-of-conduct"></a>Code of Conduct

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
  environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
  disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.
* Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that
  might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every
  design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous
  costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid
  ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
  anyone.  That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term
  "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of
  Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any lack of
  clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read
  their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that
  excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if
  you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable
  by a community member, please contact us at info@ropensci.org 
  immediately with a capture (log, photo, email) of the harassment if possible. 
  Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we 
  care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got
  your back.
* Likewise, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other
  attention-stealing behavior are not welcome.
* Avoid the use of personal pronouns in code comments or
  documentation. There is no need to address persons when explaining
  code (e.g. "When the developer")
