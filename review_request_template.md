Dear [REVIEWER]

Hi, this is [EDITOR]. [FRIENDLY BANTER]. I'm writing to ask if you would be willing to review a research compendium for DataONE. As you probably know, DataONE conducts peer review of research compendia in a manner similar to journals.

The compendium, [PACKAGE] by [AUTHOR(S)], does [FUNCTION]. You can find it on GitHub here: [REPO LINK]. We conduct our open review process via GitHub as well, here: [ONBOARDING ISSUE]

If you accept, note that we ask reviewers to complete reviews in three weeks. (Weâ€™ve found it takes a similar amount of time to review a package as an academic paper.) 

Our [reviewers guide] details what we look for in a compendium review, and includes links to example reviews. Our standards are detailed in our [compendium guide], and we provide reviewer [template] for you to use. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to ask me or post to the [DataONE forum].

Are you able to review? If you can not, suggestions for alternate reviewers are always helpful. If I don't hear from you within a week, I will assume you are unable to review at this time. 

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[EDITOR]
